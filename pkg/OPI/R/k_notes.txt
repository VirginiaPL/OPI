kowaAP7000.opiInitialize 

    - assumes message to server is "OPI_SET_MODE 0\n"  for white-on-white
                                or "OPI_SET_MODE 0\n"  for blue-on-yellow

    - assumes return is "0\n" for no error, something else otherwise.

kowaAP7000.opiPresent.opiStaticStimulus 

    - assumes messages is one of
        "NULL\n"
        "OPI_PRESENT_STATIC x y db size duration responseWindow\n"
        "OPI_PRESENT_STATIC x y db size duration responseWindow nx ny\n"
            x and y are in degrees
            db in dB
            size is one of 1,2,3,4, 5
            duration is in milliseconds
            responseWindow is in milliseconds
            nx and ny are in degrees  (the location of the next stimulus to present)

    - return string is
        "errMessage|||seen|||time|||n x1 x2 ... xn y1 y2 ... yn\n"
            errMessage is "null" for no error, otherwise an error message
            seen is 1 for yes, 0 for not seen
            time is response time
            n is the number of pupil coordinates
            x1, x2, ... , xn are the x-coordinates of the pupil position
            y1, y2, ... , yn are the y-coordinates of the pupil position

kowaAP7000.opiPresent.opiKineticStimulus 
    - assumes messages is one of
        "NULL\n"
        "OPI_PRESENT_KINETIC n x1 ... xn y1 ... yn db1 ... dbn s1 ... sn p1 ... pn\n"
            x* and y* are in degrees
            db* in dB
            s* is one of 1,2,3,4,5  (sizes)
            p* is time in seconds (speed)

    - return string is
    "errMessage|||seen|||time|||x|||y\n"
            errMessage is "null" for no error, otherwise an error message
            seen is 1 for yes, 0 for not seen
            time is response time
            x is x-coordinate when button pressed
            y is y-coordinate when button pressed

kowaAP7000.opiSetBackground 
    - assumes message is one of
        "OPI_SET_FIXATION 0\n"
        "OPI_SET_FIXATION 1\n"
        "OPI_SET_FIXATION 2\n"

        for FIX_CENTRE==0 FIX_SQUARE==1 FIX_DIAMOND ==2

    - return string is "0\n" for success or some other for fail


kowaAP7000.opiClose 
    - assumes message is
        "OPI_CLOSE\n"
    - no return message is ignored.
