# OPI - Open Perimetry Interface

The Open Perimetry Interface (OPI) can be used for controlling visual field machines using [GNU R](http://www.r-project.org/). It specifies basic functions that allow many visual field tests to be constructed. It is part of the [Open Perimetry Initiative](http://perimetry.org/opi).

Once the package is downloaded and installed, it can be used to control the perimeters listed under "Supported Perimeters", with library routines to perform thresholding using the algorithms listed under the "Test Procedures".

## Supported Perimeters
- Octopus 900
- HEP
- Simulator

## Test Procedures
- MOCS
- ZEST
- Full Threshold
